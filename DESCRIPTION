Title: Single-cell Splicing Estimation based on Network Diffusion
Version: 1.0.0

Description: Alternative splicing (AS) significantly contributes to cellular 
    transcriptomic heterogeneity, and single-cell RNA-Seq is commonly employed to 
    delineate this heterogeneity. However, due to high dropout rates, inevitable 
    noise, and limited coverage, accurately characterizing splicing changes at 
    single-cell level remains challenging. To address this, we present a computational 
    framework called SCSES (Single-Cell Splicing EStimation) to improve the AS 
    profiles, which imputes the junction count matrix and fills in missing AS 
    alternations by sharing information across similar cells or events with data 
    diffusion.
