ImputationAll(
  paras,

\arguments{
\item{paras}{list fromJSON(paras_file)
Default decay_impute from paras}

\item{output_path}{path to event similarity}

\item{decay_impute}{threshold of change in the similarity matrix}

\item{rc}{matrix of normalized splicing events associated read counts or path
to a rds file, default: rds_processed/rc.rds}

\item{psi}{matrix of psi value or path to a rds file,
default: rds_processed/psi.rds}

\item{event.info}{list of events information or path to a rds file,
default: rds_processed/event.info.list.rds}

\item{cell_similarity}{a list of different types of cell similarity named by the data
type (EXP_RBP, RC, and PSI) or path to a rds file, 
default: imputation/cell_similarity/cell.similars.rds}

\item{event_similarity}{a list of event similarity named by different types of
splicing events or path to a rds file, 
default: imputation/event_similarity/event.similars.rds}
}
\value{
path to the result of three imputation strategies
save a list of three imputation strategies result to
work_path/imputation/Imputed_seperated_*.rds.
The result contains two lists, each of which contains multiple imputation results.
Different event types are combined.
The first list is the result of strategy1 and strategy2, where the name of each matrix 
is divided by _, the first half represents different cell similarities, and the second 
half represents PSI for strategy1 and RC for strategy2; 
The second list is the result of strategy3, again where the names of each matrix are 
divided by _, with the first half representing different cell similarities
}
\description{
run three PSI imputation strategies used
All types of cell similarity and splicing events are used
first: strategy1 impute the raw PSI with cell similarities
second: strategy2 first impute raw read counts with cell similarities
and calculate the imputed PSI
third: strategy3 first impute the PSI using strategy 2, then further impute
 the results using event similarities
