\title{Launch SCSES Configuration Shiny Application}
\usage{
createConfigshiny(host = "127.0.0.1", port = 9999, launch.browser = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{host}{A character string specifying the IPv4 address that the
application should listen on. Default is "127.0.0.1" (localhost only).}

\item{port}{An integer specifying the TCP port that the application should
listen on. Must be between 1 and 65535. Default is 9999.}

\item{launch.browser}{A logical value indicating whether to automatically
launch the system's default web browser to open the application.
Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{NULL} invisibly. The function is called for its side
  effect of launching the Shiny application.
}
\description{
This function starts a Shiny web application that provides an interactive
interface for configuring SCSES parameters. The application runs on a
local web server and can be accessed through a web browser.
}
\details{
The function locates the Shiny application directory within the SCSES package
and launches it using \code{shiny::runApp()}. The application will continue
running until manually stopped (Ctrl+C in R console).

\strong{Important Notes:}
\itemize{
  \item Setting \code{launch.browser = TRUE} may cause errors in headless
        environments (servers without GUI) or when no default browser is configured
  \item Ensure the specified port is not already in use by another application
}

\strong{Server Environment Usage:}

For server environments, it is recommended to:
\enumerate{
  \item Set the host to the server's IP address
  \item Set \code{launch.browser = FALSE} to avoid browser launch errors
  \item Manually access the application URL shown in the console
}

After starting the application, you will see console output similar to:
\preformatted{Listening on http://123.678.112.78:9999}

Copy this URL and paste it into your web browser to access the application.
}
