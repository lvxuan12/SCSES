\arguments{
\item{paras}{A list object containing SCSES configuration parameters, typically
loaded using \code{readSCSESconfig(paras_file)}.}

\item{rds_imputed_file}{Character string specifying the path to RDS file containing
imputation results from multiple strategies. This should be the output file path
returned by the \code{\link{ImputationAll}} function.}

\item{output_path}{Character string specifying the output directory for final
combined imputation results. Default: \code{work_path/imputation/}.}

\item{cell_similarity}{Either a list of cell similarity matrices named by data
types (EXP_RBP, RC, PSI) or a character string path to an RDS file.
Default: \code{imputation/cell_similarity/cell.similars.rds}.}

\item{dyk_cell}{Either a list of neighbor numbers named by data types
(EXP_RBP, RC, PSI) or a character string path to an RDS file.
Default: \code{imputation/cell_similarity/dyk.cell.rds}.}

\item{rc}{Either a matrix of normalized splicing event read counts or a
character string path to an RDS file. Default: \code{rds_processed/rc.rds}.}

\item{psi}{Either a matrix of PSI values or a character string path to an
RDS file. Default: \code{rds_processed/psi.rds}.}

\item{expr}{Either a matrix of gene expression (TPM for full-length protocols,
normalized UMI counts for droplet-based protocols) or a character string
path to an RDS file. Default: \code{rds_processed/expr.rds}.}

\item{event}{Either a data.frame of event information or a character string
path to an RDS file. Default: \code{rds_processed/event.rds}.}
}
\value{
Character string specifying the path to the RDS file containing
  the final combined imputation results. The returned list is named by
  similarity types, with each element containing the combined PSI matrix
  for that similarity approach.
}
\description{
This function combines results from different imputation strategies
  using a probabilistic weighting scheme based on event-cell pair classifications.
  Strategy 1 is applied to pairs in ND, Strategy 2 to pairs in BD and TD+Info,
  and Strategy 3 to pairs in TD-Info. The final imputation combines these strategies
  weighted by classification probabilities.
