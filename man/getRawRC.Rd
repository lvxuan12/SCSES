\usage{
getRawRC(
  paras,
  bam_path = paras$Basic$bam_path,
  core = paras$Basic$core,
  sequence = paras$Basic$sequence,
  event_types = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{paras}{A list object containing SCSES configuration parameters, typically
loaded using \code{readSCSESconfig(paras_file)}.}

\item{bam_path}{Character string specifying the directory containing single-cell
BAM files. Eachcoordinate-sorted BAM file should represent one cell and
be properly indexed. Default is taken from \code{paras$Basic$bam_path}.}

\item{core}{Integer specifying the number of CPU cores for parallel processing.
Default: \code{paras$Basic$core}.}

\item{sequence}{Character string indicating the sequencing protocol type.
Default: \code{paras$Basic$sequence}. Accepted values:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"full-length"}
  \item \code{"UMI"}
}
This parameter determines which Java script is applied for read counting.}

\item{event_types}{Character string specifying splicing event types to process,
separated by semicolons (e.g., "SE;MXE;A3SS"). Default: \code{NULL} (process all
available event types). Valid event types include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"SE"}: Skipped Exon events
  \item \code{"MXE"}: Mutually Exclusive Exon events
  \item \code{"A3SS"}: Alternative 3' Splice Site events
  \item \code{"A5SS"}: Alternative 5' Splice Site events
  \item \code{"RI"}: Retained Intron events
}}
}
\value{
Character string specifying the path to the output directory
  (\code{work_path/splicing_value/}) containing event-specific read count
  RDS files and intermediate junction matrices. This path serves as input
  for downstream PSI calculation via \code{\link{calculatePSI}}.
}
\description{
This function performs quantification of raw junction
  reads across different types of splicing events from single-cell
  RNA-seq BAM files. It extracts splice junction coverage for inclusion
  and exclusion isoforms, providing the raw junction reads data required for
  downstream PSI calculation. The function supports both full-length
  and UMI-based sequencing protocols.
